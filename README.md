# counter
Clone the counter template code from here: https://github.com/apprenticecloud/counter

In this assignment your are supposed to add functionality for the +10, +15, +20 buttons

The +5 button functionality is already done for you as an example.

# Description 

the value in the <h1> tag should increment based on the value of the button clicked

e.g;

if the value in the button is +10 it should take the previous value in the <h1> tag and increment 10 to it. this is also what should happen if the +20 button is clicked. The previous value should be taken and 20 added onto it.

NOTE: Stick to the function approach because that is what we covered today and it would suite you best if you deeply understood functions.
